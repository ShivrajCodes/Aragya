              <strong>Prepare the Equipment:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Wash your hands with soap and water to prevent contamination.</li>
                <li>Ensure all parts of the nebulizer are clean and dry before assembly.</li>
                <li>Plug in the nebulizer compressor or ensure it has sufficient battery charge if it's a portable model.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Assemble the Nebulizer:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Attach the air tubing to the air outlet on the compressor.</li>
                <li>Connect the other end of the tubing to the base of the nebulizer cup.</li>
                <li>Open the nebulizer cup and place the prescribed medication inside. Make sure you use the exact amount prescribed by your doctor.</li>
                <li>Reassemble the nebulizer cup securely.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Attach the Mouthpiece or Mask:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Attach the mouthpiece or mask to the top of the nebulizer cup. Use a mouthpiece if possible, as it delivers more medication to the lungs. Use a mask if the mouthpiece is not suitable, especially for young children or those who cannot hold the mouthpiece.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Position Yourself:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Sit in a comfortable, upright position to allow your lungs to fully expand.</li>
                <li>Place the mouthpiece in your mouth and close your lips around it. If using a mask, place it over your nose and mouth, securing it with the elastic band.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Turn on the Nebulizer:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Turn on the compressor by pressing the power button.</li>
                <li>You should see a fine mist coming from the mouthpiece or mask.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Inhale the Medication:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Breathe in slowly and deeply through your mouth if using a mouthpiece, or through your nose and mouth if using a mask.</li>
                <li>Hold each breath for 2-3 seconds before exhaling to allow the medication to settle in your lungs.</li>
                <li>Continue breathing slowly and deeply until all the medication in the nebulizer cup is used up. This usually takes about 10-15 minutes.</li>

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Check Responsiveness:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Tap the person on the shoulder and shout loudly, "Are you okay?" Check for any response, such as movement or sound.</li>
              </ul>

            <li>
              <strong>Call for Help:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>If there is no response, or if the person is not breathing normally (gasping or not breathing at all), immediately call emergency services (911 or local emergency number) for help.</li>
                <li>If there is someone nearby, ask them to call for help and bring an AED (Automated External Defibrillator), if available.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Open the Airway:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Gently tilt the person's head back and lift the chin to open the airway. This helps ensure clear passage for air to enter and exit the lungs.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Check for Breathing:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Look, listen, and feel for signs of normal breathing. Watch for chest rise, listen for breathing sounds, and feel for breath on your cheek.</li>
                <li>If the person is not breathing normally, proceed to CPR.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Begin Chest Compressions:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Place the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest, between the nipples.</li>
                <li>Place your other hand on top of the first hand, interlocking your fingers.</li>
                <li>Position your shoulders directly above your hands, with elbows locked.</li>
                <li>Push down hard and fast, compressing the chest at least 2 inches (5 centimeters) deep for adult and adolescent victims. Allow the chest to recoil completely between compressions.</li>
                <li>Perform chest compressions at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute, to the beat of the song "Stayin' Alive" by the Bee Gees or using a metronome for guidance.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Give Rescue Breaths (if trained and willing):</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Tilt the person's head back and lift the chin again to open the airway.</li>
                <li>Pinch the person's nose shut.</li>
                <li>Give two rescue breaths, each lasting about 1 second and making sure the chest rises with each breath.</li>
                <li>If rescue breaths do not go in, reposition the head and try again.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Continue CPR:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Perform cycles of 30 chest compressions followed by 2 rescue breaths (if giving breaths).</li>
                <li>Continue CPR until:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Help arrives and takes over.</li>
                    <li>An AED becomes available and is ready to use.</li>
                    <li>You are too exhausted to continue.</li>
                    <li>The person starts breathing normally.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Use an AED (if available):</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Follow the prompts and instructions provided by the AED.</li>
                <li>Apply the pads to the person's bare chest as shown in the diagrams on the pads.</li>
                <li>Allow the AED to analyze the heart rhythm. If a shock is advised, make sure no one is touching the person and press the shock button as directed.</li>
                <li>Resume CPR immediately after delivering the shock, following the AED prompts.</li>
