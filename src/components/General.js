    <ol>
      <li>Prepare the Inhaler:
        <ul>
          <li>Remove the cap from the mouthpiece and check for any debris or foreign objects.</li>
          <li>Shake the inhaler well (usually for about 5-10 seconds) to mix the medication properly.</li>
          <li>If it’s a new inhaler or hasn’t been used in a while, you might need to prime it by spraying a few puffs into the air.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Position Yourself:
        <ul>
          <li>Sit up or stand up straight to ensure your lungs can fully expand.</li>
          <li>Breathe out fully to empty your lungs.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Position the Inhaler:
        <ul>
          <li>Without a Spacer:
            <ul>
              <li>Place the mouthpiece of the inhaler into your mouth, sealing your lips around it.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>With a Spacer:
            <ul>
              <li>Attach the spacer to the inhaler and place the mouthpiece of the spacer into your mouth, sealing your lips around it.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Inhale the Medication:
        <ul>
          <li>Press down on the inhaler to release a dose of medication while simultaneously taking a slow, deep breath in.</li>
          <li>If using a spacer, press down on the inhaler and then take a slow, deep breath in through the spacer.</li>
          <li>Continue to inhale slowly and deeply to ensure the medication reaches your lungs.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Hold Your Breath:
        <ul>
          <li>Hold your breath for about 10 seconds to allow the medication to settle in your lungs.</li>
          <li>Exhale slowly through your mouth or nose.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Repeat if Necessary:
        <ul>
          <li>If you need a second dose, wait about 30 seconds to 1 minute between puffs.</li>
          <li>Shake the inhaler again and repeat the steps.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>After Using the Inhaler:
        <ul>
          <li>Replace the cap on the inhaler.</li>
          <li>If the inhaler contains a steroid medication, rinse your mouth with water and spit it out to prevent oral thrush (a fungal infection).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Tips for Using an Inhaler:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a Spacer: If you have difficulty coordinating the inhaler puff and your breath, use a spacer. It helps ensure more medication reaches your lungs.</li>
      <li>Check Dosage Counter: Some inhalers have a dosage counter. Keep track of the doses left to know when to get a refill.</li>
      <li>Clean the Inhaler: Regularly clean the mouthpiece and spacer to prevent medication buildup and ensure proper functioning.</li>
      <li>Practice Proper Technique: Make sure you are using the correct technique. Ask your healthcare provider to watch and guide you if needed.</li>

          <li>Reassemble the nebulizer cup securely.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Attach the Mouthpiece or Mask:
        <ul>
          <li>Attach the mouthpiece or mask to the top of the nebulizer cup. Use a mouthpiece if possible, as it delivers more medication to the lungs. Use a mask if the mouthpiece is not suitable, especially for young children or those who cannot hold the mouthpiece.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Position Yourself:
        <ul>
          <li>Sit in a comfortable, upright position to allow your lungs to fully expand.</li>
          <li>Place the mouthpiece in your mouth and close your lips around it. If using a mask, place it over your nose and mouth, securing it with the elastic band.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Turn on the Nebulizer:
        <ul>
          <li>Turn on the compressor by pressing the power button.</li>
          <li>You should see a fine mist coming from the mouthpiece or mask.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Inhale the Medication:
        <ul>
          <li>Breathe in slowly and deeply through your mouth if using a mouthpiece, or through your nose and mouth if using a mask.</li>
          <li>Hold each breath for 2-3 seconds before exhaling to allow the medication to settle in your lungs.</li>
          <li>Continue breathing slowly and deeply until all the medication in the nebulizer cup is used up. This usually takes about 10-15 minutes.</li>

          <li>Check for any hazards or dangers that could harm you or the person.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Check Responsiveness:
        <ul>
          <li>Tap the person on the shoulder and shout loudly, "Are you okay?" Check for any response, such as movement or sound.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Call for Help:
        <ul>
          <li>If there is no response, or if the person is not breathing normally (gasping or not breathing at all), immediately call emergency services (911 or local emergency number) for help.</li>
          <li>If there is someone nearby, ask them to call for help and bring an AED (Automated External Defibrillator), if available.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Open the Airway:
        <ul>
          <li>Gently tilt the person's head back and lift the chin to open the airway. This helps ensure clear passage for air to enter and exit the lungs.</li>

      <li>Check for Breathing:
        <ul>
          <li>Look, listen, and feel for signs of normal breathing. Watch for chest rise, listen for breathing sounds, and feel for breath on your cheek.</li>
          <li>If the person is not breathing normally, proceed to CPR.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Begin Chest Compressions:
        <ul>
          <li>Place the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest, between the nipples.</li>
          <li>Place your other hand on top of the first hand, interlocking your fingers.</li>
          <li>Position your shoulders directly above your hands, with elbows locked.</li>
          <li>Push down hard and fast, compressing the chest at least 2 inches (5 centimeters) deep for adult and adolescent victims. Allow the chest to recoil completely between compressions.</li>
          <li>Perform chest compressions at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute, to the beat of a song like "Stayin' Alive" by the Bee Gees.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Perform Rescue Breaths:
        <ul>
          <li>After 30 chest compressions, give 2 rescue breaths.</li>
          <li>Pinch the person's nose shut and cover their mouth with yours, creating an airtight seal.</li>
          <li>Breathe into the person's mouth for about 1 second, watching for chest rise. If the chest does not rise, reposition the head and try again.</li>
          <li>Continue with cycles of 30 chest compressions and 2 rescue breaths until help arrives, an AED is available, or the person starts breathing normally.</li>
        </ul>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Equipment:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Ensure you have an emergency oxygen kit, which typically includes an oxygen cylinder, regulator, tubing, and mask or nasal cannula.</li>
                <li>Check the oxygen cylinder to make sure it has enough oxygen. The pressure gauge should show an adequate level (usually above 200 psi).</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Assemble the Equipment:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Attach the regulator to the oxygen cylinder by aligning the pins and tightening the screw clamp until it is secure.</li>
                <li>Attach the oxygen tubing to the regulator’s outlet.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Turn On the Oxygen:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Turn the cylinder valve counterclockwise to open it slowly. You should hear a hissing sound as the oxygen flows into the regulator.</li>
                <li>Set the flow rate on the regulator according to the manufacturer’s instructions or medical guidance. Common flow rates are 6-10 liters per minute (LPM) for a face mask and 1-6 LPM for a nasal cannula.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Apply the Oxygen:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Using a Face Mask:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Place the mask over the person’s nose and mouth, ensuring a snug fit.</li>
                    <li>Secure the elastic band around the back of the person’s head.</li>
                    <li>Adjust the metal clip over the nose for a better fit, if necessary.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Using a Nasal Cannula:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Place the nasal prongs into the person’s nostrils.</li>
                    <li>Loop the tubing over the ears and adjust the slider under the chin to hold the cannula in place.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Monitor the Person:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Check the person’s response to the oxygen. Look for signs of improved breathing and color (less bluish or pale skin).</li>
                <li>Ensure the oxygen is flowing continuously and the equipment is functioning properly.</li>
                <li>Reassure the person and keep them calm.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
